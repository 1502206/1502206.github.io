			<h1>Week 1 </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The first week of these blogs begin the week prior to the submission of the honours proposal so as such all efforts are focused on said project.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began with me reviewing all sources and research notes that I had accrued over the prior weeks, highlighting the important information and links, as well as removing the less influential resources. Ones this information was appropriately aggregated the writing process began.</p>
			<p class="lead">Writing was split over two days;</p>
			<p class="lead">Day one, I had completed a page and a half of the proposal as well as adding all relevant references. Progress was halted for the day due to both a writerâ€™s block and an urgent gym appointment with the girlfriend.</p>
			<p class="lead">Day two, More fruitful than its predecessor. Sore from the gym I was compelled to stay at my desk and write. Writers block gone I managed to complete the remainder of the proposal.</p>
			<p class="lead">Once completed I skimmed the document to check if it all made sense before emailing it off to my supervisor for review and to schedule a meeting. Meeting was scheduled for Thursday 4th at 11:30am.</p>
			<p class="lead">Meeting went well, Jackie was clear and concise about what needed changed and had provided notes on the document its self to ease editing. Conversations were also had about projected grade as well as any other changes that could be made to excel the project to a higher grade. Once all notes were made I returned home to refine the proposal.</p>

			<h1>Week 2  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The second week of these blogs begin the week of the honours proposal submission, as such the beginning of the week was focused on this week was focused on the completion of this task.</p>
			<p class="lead">Monday of this week resumed with me applying areas of the feedback provided on the prior Thursday. Most notes were small adjustments such as a spelling mistake that had slipped through and the removal of a couple of unnecessary features like a risk assessment and gantt chart. These features where no longer required in the proposal as they had been in previous years.</p>
			<p class="lead">Not all notes could be completed on the Monday however. Due to my terrible memory I had forgotten what one of the notes referred to, so I had to leave it until the drop-in session on Tuesday to discuss it with my supervisor. Once discussed however all the relevant changes were made and the project was submitted on the 9th of October at 11:46am.</p>
			<p class="lead">Feeling pleased that my project was submitted with time to spare I took a few days that week to relax as a reward to myself, knowing that I would have very little time to do this in the coming weeks. On the Thursday of that week I had a second meeting with my supervisor where we discussed the proposal submission as well as development steps moving forward.</p>

			<h1>Week 3  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The second week of these blogs will focus on the development of the applications accompanying website as well as revisiting Android studio and getting reacquainted with its features and functions.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began with me designing and building the website to host all supplementary project information. The reason I chose to do this is that I feel that Blackboard is not a stable or sufficient hub to store all project data. The solution to this was to develop my own site where I am able to update and store documents at my leisure. The benefit to this is that all the relevant information regarding my project can be easily accessed and viewed in one place. This combined with the sites later role of providing contact details to users of the completed application to allow the submission of feedback and bug reports.</p>
			<p class="lead">The site was finished midweek however due to issues with the hosting site I was unable to make the site live for review by supervisor. As such I decided to use the rest of the week to begin reading up on Android studio, since it had been a couple years since I had last developed on the environment I felt it best to collect as much written and video information on the program and basic development methods.</p>
			<p class="lead">This sentiment was echoed at the supervisors meeting where we discussed the ISP issue as well as the beginning of the Android studio research.</p>
