			<h1>Week 1 </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The first week of these blogs begin the week prior to the submission of the honours proposal as such all efforts are focused on said project.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began with me reviewing all sources and research notes that I had accrued over the prior weeks, highlighting the important information and links, as well as removing the less influential resources. Ones this information was appropriately aggregated the writing process began. Links to all resources used during this phase of development are listed on the accompanying development website (https://1502206.github.io/)</p>
			<p class="lead">The writing process was split over two days. The contents of these days are detailed below;</p>
			<p class="lead">Day one: Consisted of a page and a half of writing covering the project abstract, introduction and the background. As well these sections I included all relevant references up until this point. Progress was halted for the day due to writer’s block and general lack of sleep.</p>
			<p class="lead">Day two, More fruitful than its predecessor. A better sleep encouraged me to stay at my desk and write. The following two and a half pages were finished by that evening and all subsequent references were updated.</p>
			<p class="lead">Once completed I read over the document to check if it all made sense before emailing it off to my supervisor for review and to schedule a meeting. Meeting was scheduled for Thursday 4th at 11:30am.</p>
			<p class="lead">Meeting went well, Jackie was clear and concise about what needed changed and had provided notes on the document its self to ease editing. Conversations were also had about projected grade as well as any other changes that could be made to excel the project to a higher grade. Once all notes were made I returned home to refine the proposal.</p>
			<p class="lead">The goal for the following week is to refine my proposal and to continue to research development and deployment of my project as well as to address any other documents that need to be created.</p>

			<h1>Week 2  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The second week of these blogs began the week of the honours proposal submission, as such the start of the week was entirely focused on the completion of this task.</p>
			<p class="lead">Monday of this week resumed with me applying areas of the feedback provided to me via the prior Thursday’s supervisors meeting. Most notes were small adjustments such as a spelling mistake that had slipped through my read through and the removal of a couple of unnecessary features such as a condensed risk assessment and gantt chart. These features where no longer required in the proposal as they had been in previous years, however I was advised to keep a note of them as they would be beneficial when it came to create there submittable counterparts</p>
			<p class="lead">Not all notes could be completed on the Monday however. Due to my terrible memory I had forgotten what one of the notes provided by my supervisor was referring to, so I had to leave it until the drop-in session on Tuesday to discuss it with Jackie. Once discussed however all the relevant changes were made and the project was submitted on the 9th of October at 11:46am.</p>
			<p class="lead">Feeling pleased that my project was submitted with time to spare I took a few days that week to relax as a reward to myself, knowing that I would have very little time to do this in the coming weeks. On the Thursday of that week I had a second meeting with my supervisor where we discussed the proposal submission as well as development steps moving forward.</p>
			<p class="lead">The next stage of development was to research and refamiliarize myself with Android Studio as it would be the environment to which my project would be completed in. I also discussed the creation of an auxiliary website to host research materials, blogs and post updates on the development of the application.</p>

			<h1>Week 3  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The third week of these blogs will focus on the development of the applications accompanying website as well as revisiting Android Studio and getting reacquainted with its features and functions.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began with me designing and building the website to host all supplementary project information. The reason I chose to do this is that I feel that Blackboard is not a stable or sufficient hub to store all project data. Creating my own site will also allow for an easy to access backup should my pc become corrupted or Blackboard were to crash as well as allowing me to update and store documents at my leisure. The benefit to this is that all the relevant information regarding my project can be easily accessed and viewed in one place and will be available to any and all long after I leave university. This combined with the sites later role of providing contact details to users of the completed application to allow the submission of feedback and bug reports make it a great task to undertake.</p>
			<p class="lead">Development of the site took several days, coding the HTML personally and employing a CSS that I had modified for a prior project to improve readability on both desktop and mobile. The site was finished midweek however due to issues with the hosting site, originally 000webhosting, I was unable to make the site live for review by supervisor. </p>
			<p class="lead">As such I decided to use the rest of the week to begin reading up on Android Studio, since it had been a couple years since I had last developed in the environment. As such I felt it best to collect as much written and video information on the program and basic development methods as possible. I turned to sites such as YouTube for video tutorials and sites such as Stack Overflow for specific tutorials.</p>
			<p class="lead">When my weekly supervisors meeting came around that week the revision sentiment was echoed. We also discussed the ISP issue as well as a brief refresher on the other artefacts required for the submission. It was agreed that continuing work on Android Studio should be the primary focus of the next week. </p>
