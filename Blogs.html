			<h1>Semester 1</h1>	
			<h1>Week 1 </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The first week of these blogs begin the week prior to the submission of the honours proposal as such all efforts are focused on said project.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began with me reviewing all sources and research notes that I had accrued over the prior weeks, highlighting the important information and links, as well as removing the less influential resources. Ones this information was appropriately aggregated the writing process began. Links to all resources used during this phase of development are listed on the accompanying development website (https://1502206.github.io/)</p>
			<p class="lead">The writing process was split over two days. The contents of these days are detailed below;</p>
			<p class="lead">Day one: Consisted of a page and a half of writing covering the project abstract, introduction and the background. As well these sections I included all relevant references up until this point. Progress was halted for the day due to writer’s block and general lack of sleep.</p>
			<p class="lead">Day two, More fruitful than its predecessor. A better sleep encouraged me to stay at my desk and write. The following two and a half pages were finished by that evening and all subsequent references were updated.</p>
			<p class="lead">Once completed I read over the document to check if it all made sense before emailing it off to my supervisor for review and to schedule a meeting. Meeting was scheduled for Thursday 4th at 11:30am.</p>
			<p class="lead">Meeting went well, Jackie was clear and concise about what needed changed and had provided notes on the document its self to ease editing. Conversations were also had about projected grade as well as any other changes that could be made to excel the project to a higher grade. Once all notes were made I returned home to refine the proposal.</p>
			<p class="lead">The goal for the following week is to refine my proposal and to continue to research development and deployment of my project as well as to address any other documents that need to be created.</p>

			<h1>Week 2  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The second week of these blogs began the week of the honours proposal submission, as such the start of the week was entirely focused on the completion of this task.</p>
			<p class="lead">Monday of this week resumed with me applying areas of the feedback provided to me via the prior Thursday’s supervisors meeting. Most notes were small adjustments such as a spelling mistake that had slipped through my read through and the removal of a couple of unnecessary features such as a condensed risk assessment and gantt chart. These features where no longer required in the proposal as they had been in previous years, however I was advised to keep a note of them as they would be beneficial when it came to create there submittable counterparts</p>
			<p class="lead">Not all notes could be completed on the Monday however. Due to my terrible memory I had forgotten what one of the notes provided by my supervisor was referring to, so I had to leave it until the drop-in session on Tuesday to discuss it with Jackie. Once discussed however all the relevant changes were made and the project was submitted on the 9th of October at 11:46am.</p>
			<p class="lead">Feeling pleased that my project was submitted with time to spare I took a few days that week to relax as a reward to myself, knowing that I would have very little time to do this in the coming weeks. On the Thursday of that week I had a second meeting with my supervisor where we discussed the proposal submission as well as development steps moving forward.</p>
			<p class="lead">The next stage of development was to research and refamiliarize myself with Android Studio as it would be the environment to which my project would be completed in. I also discussed the creation of an auxiliary website to host research materials, blogs and post updates on the development of the application.</p>

			<h1>Week 3  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The third week of these blogs will focus on the development of the applications accompanying website as well as revisiting Android Studio and getting reacquainted with its features and functions.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began with me designing and building the website to host all supplementary project information. The reason I chose to do this is that I feel that Blackboard is not a stable or sufficient hub to store all project data. Creating my own site will also allow for an easy to access backup should my pc become corrupted or Blackboard were to crash as well as allowing me to update and store documents at my leisure. The benefit to this is that all the relevant information regarding my project can be easily accessed and viewed in one place and will be available to any and all long after I leave university. This combined with the sites later role of providing contact details to users of the completed application to allow the submission of feedback and bug reports make it a great task to undertake.</p>
			<p class="lead">Development of the site took several days, coding the HTML personally and employing a CSS that I had modified for a prior project to improve readability on both desktop and mobile. The site was finished midweek however due to issues with the hosting site, originally 000webhosting, I was unable to make the site live for review by supervisor. </p>
			<p class="lead">As such I decided to use the rest of the week to begin reading up on Android Studio, since it had been a couple years since I had last developed in the environment. As such I felt it best to collect as much written and video information on the program and basic development methods as possible. I turned to sites such as YouTube for video tutorials and sites such as Stack Overflow for specific tutorials.</p>
			<p class="lead">When my weekly supervisors meeting came around that week the revision sentiment was echoed. We also discussed the ISP issue as well as a brief refresher on the other artefacts required for the submission. It was agreed that continuing work on Android Studio should be the primary focus of the next week. </p>

			<h1>Week 4  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The fourth week of these blogs will focus on revision and reacquaintance with Android Studio and its various features and functions.</p>
			<p class="lead">The first few days of this week mainly consisted of researching and reviewing tutorials and code samples to try and refamiliarize myself with the Android Studio environment. I gathered my information from two primary sources; YouTube and Stack Overflow. </p>
			<p class="lead">YouTube is a fantastic platform for high quality video tutorials, video tutorials are extremely useful for getting to grasp with a language you haven’t dealt with for a great period as it allows for both a visual and audio explanation of features, code and development. I found this to be my preferred learning platform due to being a more visual learner. As a result I spent a bulk of my revision time there listening to beginner tutorials from users such as Bill Butterfield (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFlPARW5IX8) and Coding in Flow (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgIUdb-7Rqo). These tutorials helped reacquaint me with the language and a portion of the suites functions.</p>
			<p class="lead">Stack Overflow on the other hand I spent less time with however I did not discredit it. The issue with the site for me personally is that despite it’s great value as a debugging tool I find it difficult to learn a great deal from the information provided. This is mainly because the site consists of solutions to peoples prior coding issues. Not to say the site is completely devoid of use, I was able to find some answers to some outlying questions I had. I wouldn’t rate it as highly as YouTube when it comes down to accessibility. </p>
			<p class="lead">At this week’s supervisors meeting I discussed this with my supervisor and noted that I was definitely feeling far more confident in my development capabilities that prior to my revision. As well as this we discussed the beginning of developing of the required and supporting documentation that would begin as of next week.</p>

			<h1>Week 5  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The fifth week of these blogs will focus on the creation and completion of the required and supporting documentation.</p>
			<p class="lead">Development of several documents began during this week, two of the most important documents were provided by the university in the form of ethics and a risk assessment.</p>
			<p class="lead">Ethics: This document consisted of various questions to gauge if my project is morally and ethically safe to be created and tested on members of the public. This covered questions such as what the makeup of my testing audience was as well as where I was sourcing my application information. As my project was deemed to be relatively low risk this document was not too daunting and allowed me to skip several unnecessary sections.</p>
			<p class="lead">Risk assessment: This document, again provided by the university, was used to determine the risk to my own wellbeing imposed by the proposed project. Due to my project being a simple mobile application developed primarily from my flat risks were deemed to be practically non-existent as the form contains a lot of job site specific questions for safety.</p>
			<p class="lead">As well as the two required artefacts discussed there was one more in the form of a personal risk assessment. This document was to contain an assessed report of issues that I have independently identified as being potential hazards when developing the project. Due to having created a smaller version of this document within my original proposal document it made the creation of the final document more streamlined. </p>
			<p class="lead">The final document that was worked on this week were some rough drafts of the applications layout and design. I designed seven of the main application screens containing button and information readout placement as well as notes on information to be displayed on each. I also included two drafts of application icons in all five of native Android resolutions to show how they would look on various resolutions. </p>
			<p class="lead">All these documents were emailed to my supervisor prior to submission as well as being discussed at our weekly meeting. At this week’s meeting we discussed the completed documents as noted as well as discussed the remaining requirements to be completed over the next week. </p>

			<h1>Week 6  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The sixth week of these blogs will continue to focus on the creation and completion of the required and supporting documentation for the honours project.</p>
			<p class="lead">As of last week most required documents have been completed as well as one of the ancillary documents. This week I was tasked by my supervisor to complete the final required document as well as to decide on the final deliverables from the proposed list. The two supplementary documents I chose were the sample code and a structure diagram.</p>
			<p class="lead">Structure diagram: This deliverable is comprised of a large well annotated image that shows the process of using the application via arrows linking named bubbles representing application screens. The goal of this diagram is to show a user the flow of the application when it is being used and what options/alternative options will be offered up to the user. It was created using an online tool hosted on (https://www.draw.io/).</p>
			<p class="lead">Sample code: This deliverable was to contain a functioning piece of code accompanied with screenshots to show its function. I resorted to creating the home page of my application as well as the three subpages, in my case ‘Servicing’, ‘Maintenance’ and ‘Testing’. This would give a better idea of how the completed application would look and feel on a mobile device, to help improve future testing I intentionally developed the application to the resolution of my own phone for better testing results. Development of this deliverable was not able to be finished this week. </p>
			<p class="lead">This week’s supervisors meeting we discussed my progress with the deliverables as well as addressed several questions I had regarding completed and upcoming documents. It was agreed that work should continue as is with the goal of completing all documentation before the feasibility demo in week 11.</p>

			<h1>Week 7  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The seventh week of these blogs will continue to focus on the creation and completion of the final supporting documentation prior to the feasibility demo in week 11.</p>
			<p class="lead">Work continued this week on the sample code, much time was spent referencing various YouTube tutorials and Stack Overflow code dumps to discern what needed to be implemented to have a user friendly and easy to navigate application, or at least as demonstrable section of code. After several days of work I had completed the code requirement and was then able to take screenshots of both the code itself and the designed screens of the application running.</p>
			<p class="lead">The final artefact required for submission was the research question. After having a meeting with my supervisor on the Thursday of this week I confirmed what was required for the document, I subsequently began work at the end of the week with the goal of having it finished in a short period of time. Once completed I sent a draft off to my supervisor to confirm that I was on the right path and shortly after I received feedback from my supervisor. Several changes were required for the document to meet the outlined standards, which I completed that evening </p>
			<p class="lead">To date I have all the required artefacts for the demo on week 11, all completed items were shown to my supervisor at the time of our meeting and were altered if necessary. As mentioned prior the research question was not completed by the time of this meeting it was however emailed for review as noted previously.</p>
			<p class="lead">The rest of the week was spent working on projects for other classes as assessments and other deadlines were looming. With no more development being required on the feasibility demo all files were stored securely and remotely backed up in preparation for the following week where they will be demoed. Next week will focus on demo preparation and the demo itself.</p>

			<h1>Week 8  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The eighth week of these blogs will cover the feasibility demo preparation as well as any and all information gained from the demo itself.</p>
			<p class="lead">This week had one very basic goal and that was to prepare for the feasibility demo. I set about doing this by first of all reading through all of my documents that I had created for demonstration purposed. This allowed me to get a refreshed grasp of what the primary goal of each deliverable was and then note down the best way to explain this during the demonstration.</p>
			<p class="lead">Once I was happy that I understood what everything was there for I enlisted the aid of my girlfriend to play the part of a client and allow me to explain each individual section to her to see if I was able to articulate my understanding of what I had created. After an hour or so of going through all documents she was happy that I could explain it to her in a way that was clear and concise.</p>
			<p class="lead">The final step of preparation was to transfer all documents to my laptop as this would be how I planned to demonstrate all of my documents. With the documents transferred I installed Android Studio to allow me to give a live demonstration of the application rather than just having the screenshots.</p>
			<p class="lead">The demo itself was held on Thursday the 22nd of November, I was the first in at 10am. Upon meeting with my supervisor, I began my presentation of all the deliverables I had and attempting to explain them all in as much detail as possible.</p>
			<p class="lead">Upon completion of my demo I was given some fairly deflating news that my ethics had been rejected however I was advised not to worry as there was still a final meeting to decide on the course of action regarding my project. </p>
			<p class="lead">The final step of this process was to submit the all deliverables to Blackboard and with that done I had successfully finished the feasibility demo.</p>

			<h1>Semester 2</h1>	
			<h1>Week 1 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The second semester of work began on the 14/01/2019, upon returning from the winter break this week was focused primarily on identifying where I had left off and what I still had left to do.</p>
			<p class="lead">Due to the denial of ethical approval for my originally proposed project I was forced to change the focus of my project thereby derailing all momentum built up before the end of term 1. As a result of this I had taken the last week of my holiday to research data on the new subject instead of having it as time off as originally budgeted. This sacrifice allowed for more time to be focused on the interviews and development.</p>
			<p class="lead">Upon returning a meeting was held on the 16/01/2019 with my supervisor and all other students she was supervising. This meeting was hosted to outline what was expected of us this semester as well as a more in-depth look into required artefacts and a general Q&A session. This session helped immensely as it provided a good jumping off point for the rest of the project.</p>
			<p class="lead">The rest of the week consisted of reading and reviewing previously accumulated research in addition to the extra information provided by my supervisor at the group meeting. My supervisor had contacted me later in the week to arrange out first one on one meeting of the semester, dated for 25/01/2019. The goal was to aim to have a more defined idea of final implementation for the newly proposed project. </p>

			<h1>Week 2 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The second week of the semester began as week one left off with the aim of having a more refined idea as to the ultimate vision for the honours project application.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began with reviewing all documentation that had been produced in the first semester and seeing what was salvageable from the original designs. My supervisor had noted last semester that a complete rewrite of documentation was unnecessary however it could help save sometime in the long run.</p>
			<p class="lead">The applications base layout was salvageable as there was little development at this stage into core mechanics, such as servicing intervals, this would allow for a quick turnaround for updating the apps focus. </p>
			<p class="lead">The documentation crated in semester one did allow for the main structure of the app to be transferred over however all the research done for the automotive aspect was unusable with the app’s current direction. Fortunately, all research done into the fields of M-Learning and mobile phones as a whole was useable in the final project.</p>
			<p class="lead">As noted in a previous blog post there was a meeting arranged with my supervisor for Friday 25th of January, this meeting was used as a more one on one discussion of the upcoming project milestones as well as a general overview of my project process so far. The ethics denial was once again noted at this meeting putting me slightly behind other students, however not irredeemably so. The first major submission due was for week four and was to be a progress check, this was to entail a formal discussion as display of evidence to the projects development. This was also to be followed up by an altered project plan/gantt chart in necessary, which in my case it was.</p>
			<p class="lead">The next weeks goal was to get a leg up on these development milestones and be prepared for this review.  </p>

			<h1>Week 3 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The third week of the semester began by following up on the plans laid out in week two with the ultimate goal of having the milestone items required for review ready and with ample time to surpass those requirements.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began by tackling the reengineering of the project plan/gantt chart as it would be beneficial to have a timeline set in stone to review whenever required. There was significant change required in the chart due to the denial of the original ethics and the approval of the new project. Whereas in the original table there was only plans for three weeks each of gamification research as well as analysis and design there had to be two ancillary weeks included before the project could move on. This also had a knock-on effect when it came to testing and evaluation as time had to be redistributed to allow for more to be spent on implementation. One upside was that due to the changing in distribution model there was less time required for that part of the project allowing for some time to be salvaged. </p>
			<p class="lead">Moving onto the application, since the main structure was useable and only required a subject change to be brought into line with current plans work began to alter the app. All references to automotive repair and maintenance were removed and replaced with three menus listing ‘Maintenance’, ‘Building’ and ‘Score’. Once the home screen had been laid out fitting for the new theme the submenus were tackled, with all topics to be covered by the app chosen. Once the topics were chosen buttons relating to each were implemented and laid out, completing each educational submenu. </p>
			<p class="lead">Feeling confident in these amendments surpassing what was sought for this early stage progress review I spent the rest of the week researching ways to implement a gamification element into the application. This research carried into the next week of the project.  </p>

			<h1>Week 4 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The fourth week of the semester began by continuing the research into a gamification element that would be an ideal fit for the project at hand. The week also contained the week four progress check mentioned in the prior weeks journal. </p>
			<p class="lead">The majority of the week was spent with the aforementioned gamification research. This was difficult as there were many methods detailed online, with a vast array of tutorials and approached for each. The issue that I faced was due to the time crunch of implementation there was not scope for a vast and expansive levelling system or a multi teared quiz system built with achievements. This combined with my general indecisiveness and rusty experience with Android Studio made it a difficult choice.</p>
			<p class="lead">The progress check was scheduled for the 6th of February 2019. The morning of the demo I loaded both the original and updated project plans/gantt charts onto my laptop, as well as the latest build of my Android application to display. The meeting went well, my supervisor noted the obvious change in my project plan/gantt chart caused by the ethics issue. The response to the app progress seemed promising too as my supervisor noted a great change since she had last seen the application and that change seemed to be taking place as a good pace and future development looks promising. </p>
			<p class="lead">With positive feedback for my efforts in hand I spent the remainder of the week continuing to plough ahead with the discovery and implementation of an appropriate gaming system for the application. This task continued to prove difficult and eluded me for the remainder of this week and into the next.</p>

			<h1>Week 5 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The fifth week of the semester began by continuing the research into a suitable gamification element for the project application, as well as beginning to build out some of the application’s other features and design. </p>
			<p class="lead">The bulk of the week was spent in and around Android Studio working on the applications features and design. The implementation of a gamification element was still being agonised over as the time constraints were becoming more apparent due to the revelation of other university projects which had to be completed simultaneously. This put considerable agency to the settling of a particular gamification method. </p>
			<p class="lead">In regard to other features worked on within the application. A percentage of the tutorials were further researched and implemented into the app, allowing for a better idea for required scale of images and text as well as how much text can be comfortably displayed on screen without being too disorientating. It was also decided that the implementation of a menu specific colour scheme would be beneficial to help with navigation.</p>
			<p class="lead">The application was beginning to take shape despite setbacks in the early stages. As the week was wrapping up it was decided that the gaming element to be used in this project would be a points system coupled with an overarching achievement system. What was meant by this is that the user would gain points for the completion of tasks in the application such as the tutorials. The user would then unlock achievements for reaching specific goals and milestones within the app. This was deemed to be the most complete and engaging gaming element that could be implemented within the chosen app and time constraint. </p>
			<p class="lead">With this week finishing up implementation of the chosen gamification method was scheduled to be carried out in week 6 and will be detailed within it’s companion journal. </p>

			<p class="lead">As noted work began on the implementation of the gamification framework, the first step in this process was to determine which acts would warrant the distribution of points for the user. To stick to the core principles of M-Learning it was decided that the user should be awarded points for the completion of tutorials as this was the core learning aspect of the application. From this conclusion a list of appropriate attainable achievements was drafted as a further stage of gamification for those using the application.</p>
			<p class="lead">To aid in the completion of the gamification framework it was essential that all screens were implemented into the app, this resulted in all tutorial screens being implemented without text or images. This information would be filled in at a later stage. The screens were implemented to allow for the complete installation of the gamification element for testing purposes. </p>
			<p class="lead">In accompaniment to this development a meeting was set up with my supervisor for the 22/02/2019 to discuss progress and to attain any help in regard to the development. There was also discussion into the week 7 progress check which took the form of a PowerPoint slide discussing what was left to be completed in regard to the project. </p>
			<p class="lead">The meeting went well with progress being updated and my supervisor seeming pleased with current development pace. It was noted that work on the dissertation should begin shortly as there was a draft chapter review submission in week 10. I had stated that work on the dissertation would begin as of week 7. </p>

			<h1>Week 7 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The seventh week of the semester began completing the progress check for the application development. Development then shifted towards the writing of the dissertation for the draft chapter submission in week 10.</p>
			<p class="lead">The progress check slide was simple to complete, a single slide used to encapsulate what had been completed to date and what still had to be completed to finish the app. This slide took a single afternoon at the start of the week allowing for plenty time to focus on the writing of the dissertation. </p>
			<p class="lead">In preparation for the dissertation the PowerPoints regarding the design and contents were reviewed as well as reviewing some previously submitted dissertations to get a feel for the writing style required. With the use of the dissertation draft writing began, with the noted goal for one completed section or a collection of smaller partially complete sections to indicate work on the dissertation being carried out. </p>
			<p class="lead">The work on the dissertation was the main focus of the week with other projects being side-lined to accommodate the writing process. However due to the amount of information required for dissertation standers it was clear early on that this was a task that would span more than one week. </p>
			<p class="lead">Writing began with setting out the majority of the main headings providing structure to the proceedings. The process then continued with the writing of the abstract and work beginning on the introduction. This was a time consuming process due to the lack of relevant semester 1 resources to refer to due to the project focus change.</p>
			<p class="lead">As noted earlier work on the dissertation looked as if it would span several weeks and as the week ended it was apparent that it would require at least one more week to be in any fit state to meet the draft dissertation requirements.    </p>

			<h1>Week 8 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The eighth week of the semester began by continuing to write the draft chapters that began in week 7 with the goal of completing several smaller sections by weeks end.</p>
			<p class="lead">At the beginning of the week a supervisor meeting was scheduled for the Friday the 8th of March to discuss general project progress and to answer any logistical questions that I had for the continuing development of the app and dissertation.</p>
			<p class="lead">As noted previously the main goal of this week was to continue the writing of the dissertation with the goal of having a several section draft to submit for review. The majority of this week was taken up by the writing of these required sections. The introduction that was started in week 8 was completed early in the week and was then followed by the beginnings of the literature review. In addition to these larger sections there were several smaller sections completed that aided in providing a better representation of my proposed work. These sections included application testing approach, implementation of the website and the methodology. These sections totalling to a respectable 2153 words out of a proposed 9,000-11,000.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week was concluded by the aforementioned supervisor meeting was conducted at the end of the week discussed dissertation progress and how I felt my work so far compared to what was requested. I noted that I had done several sections of the dissertation and wished to submit it for review before the deadline, my supervisor agreed to this and we parted ways for the week.</p>
			<p class="lead">The goal for next week was to tweak what was previously written and submit it for review. Once completed focus would return to application development.   </p>

			<h1>Week 9 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The ninth week of the semester began by submitting my draft dissertation chapters for review as well as scheduling a meeting to discuss the submission. This was also bookended by continued developmental work on the application. </p>
			<p class="lead">As stated the draft dissertation chapters were submitted early in the week after some review and editing. Once emailed to my supervisor a meeting was scheduled for Friday the 15th to discuss the progress and any amendments required.</p>
			<p class="lead">As well as this dissertation work being carried out there was renewed focus on the implementation of the gaming element to the honours project. By this stage of implementation, the framework was laid, including the presence of a separate score screen. The next step was to add the conditions for point acquisition, as mentioned in a previous week points would be awarded to the user for completing tutorials. This implementation took place over the remainder of the week resulting in a functional points system awarding the user 10 points for every tutorial completed, as well as the ability to clear their score. This feature was tested thoroughly during development to make sure that it worked as intended on all pages.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week concluded with the supervisor meeting to review the prior submitted dissertation chapters. This meeting went well, with only minor notes being made regarding changes required, mainly revolving around grammar and spelling. It was highlighted that going forward time should be split between the dissertation and the application development. With next weeks plans being to implement the overarching achievement system to the application as well as to finish writing up all tutorials.    </p>

			<h1>Week 10 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The tenth week of the semester began by continuing development of the application with the goal of completing the gamification implementation. In addition to this work on the dissertation was scheduled to continue alongside the aforementioned development.</p>
			<p class="lead">The development of the app took the majority of the working week with great progress being made. This included the completion of all tutorials, both text and images. This process was fairly time consuming as it required condensing a wealth of information down into three-page tutorials with the aim of making them easier to understand for those new to the subject. </p>
			<p class="lead">Once the tutorial implementation was completed then the focus returned to the overarching achievements system that was proposed in an early stage of development. The implementation of this system was becoming the sticking point of development, with almost two weeks being sunk into an attempt to get it to function with no success. </p>
			<p class="lead">It was decided later in the week to change developmental focus towards the visual style of the application with the hopes of being able to come back to the achievement system with fresh eyes. This proved to be a fruitful endeavour as it allowed for a great increase in the apps presentation by adjusting the colour scheme and implementing colour coded buttons for use in the sub menus. This phase of development also gave birth to an improved app icon and splash screen to complete the visual installation. </p>
			<p class="lead">The goal for the next week of development was to complete the implementation and get functional the proposed achievement system. The later part of this week provided a welcome break from that aspect of the app and the hope is that with some more research that the system will fall into place.</p>

			<h1>Week 11 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The eleventh week of the semester began by continuing the implementation of the gamification element with the goal of getting the feature functional. This combined with continued work on the dissertation in coalition.</p>
			<p class="lead">The first step of returning to the achievements system was to research previously completed examples and review online tutorials with the goal of finding a cohesive step by step approach to ease implementation. This search proved to be tedious and time consuming with research totalling to two days all told. </p>
			<p class="lead">Once researching had concluded attempts were made to implement an achievements system that was planned in earlier design phases, however to due to the complexity of the required feature and my limited experience it was proving to be an insurmountable task in the limited timeframe. It was decided by weeks end that the feature would have to be cut and development focus to shift to polishing the apps current features as well as continuing with the writing of the dissertation. </p>
			<p class="lead">The decision to remove the feature was not taken lightly as it cost the app a much-needed multilayer gamification aspect. However, by this stage in the project testing of the application should be on the cards so that was the next task that was undertaken.</p>
			<p class="lead">To allow people to test the app the university required the supervisors sign off on the project as well as all users to sign a consent form to state that they agreed to allow the university to store their information. Both of these forums were to be filled out and sent to the supervisor for approval and final sign off. In addition to this a user questionnaire was created to adequately assess the users interactions with the application and to gauge their opinions. </p>
			<p class="lead">The next and final week of these blogs will detail the process the finishing, testing and documenting of the application.  </p>

			<h1>Week 12 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The twelfth week of the semester began by buttoning up the final features of the application before it goes out for testing. The remainder of the week was focused on gathering users to test the application and give their thoughts and opinions on its final form. </p>
			<p class="lead">The week began as noted by finishing up the final pieces of the application that require addressing. For this developmental time the application was running on the final test device, a Samsung Galaxy S8+, this was to allow to see what any adjustments to the layout or functionality would have when run on the test device. Several aspects of the layout were adjusted including, image and text size, button placement as well as changes to the colour scheme. The final aspect added before user testing was the connection to the ancillary website that was developed to contain further information on the project subject matter, as well as a wealth of links to external resources. </p>
			<p class="lead">This final stage of development took longer than originally anticipated unfortunately pushing back the beginning of the testing and assessment phase. The testing therefor began as of the weekend of this week rather than the originally intended mid-week. The testing consisted of users who had signed the consent forums with a sixty-two-year age range to allow for as much diversity as possible. These users were then provided with the previously mentioned phone with the app preloaded, they were then asked to use as many of the applications features and complete as many tutorials as possible. Once they had finished the users were then provided with a questionnaire and a brief interview to ascertain the opinions on the app. </p>
			<p class="lead">As noted the testing did not conclude by the end of this week, however completed questionnaires have been, for the most part, positive. Users seem to agree that the application is clear and easy to navigate, with it being stated that the tutorials are useful and easy to follow.    </p>
