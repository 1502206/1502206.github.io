			<h1>Semester 1</h1>	
			<h1>Week 1 </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The first week of these blogs begin the week prior to the submission of the honours proposal as such all efforts are focused on said project.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began with me reviewing all sources and research notes that I had accrued over the prior weeks, highlighting the important information and links, as well as removing the less influential resources. Ones this information was appropriately aggregated the writing process began. Links to all resources used during this phase of development are listed on the accompanying development website (https://1502206.github.io/)</p>
			<p class="lead">The writing process was split over two days. The contents of these days are detailed below;</p>
			<p class="lead">Day one: Consisted of a page and a half of writing covering the project abstract, introduction and the background. As well these sections I included all relevant references up until this point. Progress was halted for the day due to writer’s block and general lack of sleep.</p>
			<p class="lead">Day two, More fruitful than its predecessor. A better sleep encouraged me to stay at my desk and write. The following two and a half pages were finished by that evening and all subsequent references were updated.</p>
			<p class="lead">Once completed I read over the document to check if it all made sense before emailing it off to my supervisor for review and to schedule a meeting. Meeting was scheduled for Thursday 4th at 11:30am.</p>
			<p class="lead">Meeting went well, Jackie was clear and concise about what needed changed and had provided notes on the document its self to ease editing. Conversations were also had about projected grade as well as any other changes that could be made to excel the project to a higher grade. Once all notes were made I returned home to refine the proposal.</p>
			<p class="lead">The goal for the following week is to refine my proposal and to continue to research development and deployment of my project as well as to address any other documents that need to be created.</p>

			<h1>Week 2  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The second week of these blogs began the week of the honours proposal submission, as such the start of the week was entirely focused on the completion of this task.</p>
			<p class="lead">Monday of this week resumed with me applying areas of the feedback provided to me via the prior Thursday’s supervisors meeting. Most notes were small adjustments such as a spelling mistake that had slipped through my read through and the removal of a couple of unnecessary features such as a condensed risk assessment and gantt chart. These features where no longer required in the proposal as they had been in previous years, however I was advised to keep a note of them as they would be beneficial when it came to create there submittable counterparts</p>
			<p class="lead">Not all notes could be completed on the Monday however. Due to my terrible memory I had forgotten what one of the notes provided by my supervisor was referring to, so I had to leave it until the drop-in session on Tuesday to discuss it with Jackie. Once discussed however all the relevant changes were made and the project was submitted on the 9th of October at 11:46am.</p>
			<p class="lead">Feeling pleased that my project was submitted with time to spare I took a few days that week to relax as a reward to myself, knowing that I would have very little time to do this in the coming weeks. On the Thursday of that week I had a second meeting with my supervisor where we discussed the proposal submission as well as development steps moving forward.</p>
			<p class="lead">The next stage of development was to research and refamiliarize myself with Android Studio as it would be the environment to which my project would be completed in. I also discussed the creation of an auxiliary website to host research materials, blogs and post updates on the development of the application.</p>

			<h1>Week 3  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The third week of these blogs will focus on the development of the applications accompanying website as well as revisiting Android Studio and getting reacquainted with its features and functions.</p>
			<p class="lead">The week began with me designing and building the website to host all supplementary project information. The reason I chose to do this is that I feel that Blackboard is not a stable or sufficient hub to store all project data. Creating my own site will also allow for an easy to access backup should my pc become corrupted or Blackboard were to crash as well as allowing me to update and store documents at my leisure. The benefit to this is that all the relevant information regarding my project can be easily accessed and viewed in one place and will be available to any and all long after I leave university. This combined with the sites later role of providing contact details to users of the completed application to allow the submission of feedback and bug reports make it a great task to undertake.</p>
			<p class="lead">Development of the site took several days, coding the HTML personally and employing a CSS that I had modified for a prior project to improve readability on both desktop and mobile. The site was finished midweek however due to issues with the hosting site, originally 000webhosting, I was unable to make the site live for review by supervisor. </p>
			<p class="lead">As such I decided to use the rest of the week to begin reading up on Android Studio, since it had been a couple years since I had last developed in the environment. As such I felt it best to collect as much written and video information on the program and basic development methods as possible. I turned to sites such as YouTube for video tutorials and sites such as Stack Overflow for specific tutorials.</p>
			<p class="lead">When my weekly supervisors meeting came around that week the revision sentiment was echoed. We also discussed the ISP issue as well as a brief refresher on the other artefacts required for the submission. It was agreed that continuing work on Android Studio should be the primary focus of the next week. </p>

			<h1>Week 4  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The fourth week of these blogs will focus on revision and reacquaintance with Android Studio and its various features and functions.</p>
			<p class="lead">The first few days of this week mainly consisted of researching and reviewing tutorials and code samples to try and refamiliarize myself with the Android Studio environment. I gathered my information from two primary sources; YouTube and Stack Overflow. </p>
			<p class="lead">YouTube is a fantastic platform for high quality video tutorials, video tutorials are extremely useful for getting to grasp with a language you haven’t dealt with for a great period as it allows for both a visual and audio explanation of features, code and development. I found this to be my preferred learning platform due to being a more visual learner. As a result I spent a bulk of my revision time there listening to beginner tutorials from users such as Bill Butterfield (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFlPARW5IX8) and Coding in Flow (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgIUdb-7Rqo). These tutorials helped reacquaint me with the language and a portion of the suites functions.</p>
			<p class="lead">Stack Overflow on the other hand I spent less time with however I did not discredit it. The issue with the site for me personally is that despite it’s great value as a debugging tool I find it difficult to learn a great deal from the information provided. This is mainly because the site consists of solutions to peoples prior coding issues. Not to say the site is completely devoid of use, I was able to find some answers to some outlying questions I had. I wouldn’t rate it as highly as YouTube when it comes down to accessibility. </p>
			<p class="lead">At this week’s supervisors meeting I discussed this with my supervisor and noted that I was definitely feeling far more confident in my development capabilities that prior to my revision. As well as this we discussed the beginning of developing of the required and supporting documentation that would begin as of next week.</p>

			<h1>Week 5  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The fifth week of these blogs will focus on the creation and completion of the required and supporting documentation.</p>
			<p class="lead">Development of several documents began during this week, two of the most important documents were provided by the university in the form of ethics and a risk assessment.</p>
			<p class="lead">Ethics: This document consisted of various questions to gauge if my project is morally and ethically safe to be created and tested on members of the public. This covered questions such as what the makeup of my testing audience was as well as where I was sourcing my application information. As my project was deemed to be relatively low risk this document was not too daunting and allowed me to skip several unnecessary sections.</p>
			<p class="lead">Risk assessment: This document, again provided by the university, was used to determine the risk to my own wellbeing imposed by the proposed project. Due to my project being a simple mobile application developed primarily from my flat risks were deemed to be practically non-existent as the form contains a lot of job site specific questions for safety.</p>
			<p class="lead">As well as the two required artefacts discussed there was one more in the form of a personal risk assessment. This document was to contain an assessed report of issues that I have independently identified as being potential hazards when developing the project. Due to having created a smaller version of this document within my original proposal document it made the creation of the final document more streamlined. </p>
			<p class="lead">The final document that was worked on this week were some rough drafts of the applications layout and design. I designed seven of the main application screens containing button and information readout placement as well as notes on information to be displayed on each. I also included two drafts of application icons in all five of native Android resolutions to show how they would look on various resolutions. </p>
			<p class="lead">All these documents were emailed to my supervisor prior to submission as well as being discussed at our weekly meeting. At this week’s meeting we discussed the completed documents as noted as well as discussed the remaining requirements to be completed over the next week. </p>

			<h1>Week 6  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The sixth week of these blogs will continue to focus on the creation and completion of the required and supporting documentation for the honours project.</p>
			<p class="lead">As of last week most required documents have been completed as well as one of the ancillary documents. This week I was tasked by my supervisor to complete the final required document as well as to decide on the final deliverables from the proposed list. The two supplementary documents I chose were the sample code and a structure diagram.</p>
			<p class="lead">Structure diagram: This deliverable is comprised of a large well annotated image that shows the process of using the application via arrows linking named bubbles representing application screens. The goal of this diagram is to show a user the flow of the application when it is being used and what options/alternative options will be offered up to the user. It was created using an online tool hosted on (https://www.draw.io/).</p>
			<p class="lead">Sample code: This deliverable was to contain a functioning piece of code accompanied with screenshots to show its function. I resorted to creating the home page of my application as well as the three subpages, in my case ‘Servicing’, ‘Maintenance’ and ‘Testing’. This would give a better idea of how the completed application would look and feel on a mobile device, to help improve future testing I intentionally developed the application to the resolution of my own phone for better testing results. Development of this deliverable was not able to be finished this week. </p>
			<p class="lead">This week’s supervisors meeting we discussed my progress with the deliverables as well as addressed several questions I had regarding completed and upcoming documents. It was agreed that work should continue as is with the goal of completing all documentation before the feasibility demo in week 11.</p>

			<h1>Week 7  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The seventh week of these blogs will continue to focus on the creation and completion of the final supporting documentation prior to the feasibility demo in week 11.</p>
			<p class="lead">Work continued this week on the sample code, much time was spent referencing various YouTube tutorials and Stack Overflow code dumps to discern what needed to be implemented to have a user friendly and easy to navigate application, or at least as demonstrable section of code. After several days of work I had completed the code requirement and was then able to take screenshots of both the code itself and the designed screens of the application running.</p>
			<p class="lead">The final artefact required for submission was the research question. After having a meeting with my supervisor on the Thursday of this week I confirmed what was required for the document, I subsequently began work at the end of the week with the goal of having it finished in a short period of time. Once completed I sent a draft off to my supervisor to confirm that I was on the right path and shortly after I received feedback from my supervisor. Several changes were required for the document to meet the outlined standards, which I completed that evening </p>
			<p class="lead">To date I have all the required artefacts for the demo on week 11, all completed items were shown to my supervisor at the time of our meeting and were altered if necessary. As mentioned prior the research question was not completed by the time of this meeting it was however emailed for review as noted previously.</p>
			<p class="lead">The rest of the week was spent working on projects for other classes as assessments and other deadlines were looming. With no more development being required on the feasibility demo all files were stored securely and remotely backed up in preparation for the following week where they will be demoed. Next week will focus on demo preparation and the demo itself.</p>

			<h1>Week 8  </h1>
			<p class="lead"></p>
			<p class="lead">The eighth week of these blogs will cover the feasibility demo preparation as well as any and all information gained from the demo itself.</p>
			<p class="lead">This week had one very basic goal and that was to prepare for the feasibility demo. I set about doing this by first of all reading through all of my documents that I had created for demonstration purposed. This allowed me to get a refreshed grasp of what the primary goal of each deliverable was and then note down the best way to explain this during the demonstration.</p>
			<p class="lead">Once I was happy that I understood what everything was there for I enlisted the aid of my girlfriend to play the part of a client and allow me to explain each individual section to her to see if I was able to articulate my understanding of what I had created. After an hour or so of going through all documents she was happy that I could explain it to her in a way that was clear and concise.</p>
			<p class="lead">The final step of preparation was to transfer all documents to my laptop as this would be how I planned to demonstrate all of my documents. With the documents transferred I installed Android Studio to allow me to give a live demonstration of the application rather than just having the screenshots.</p>
			<p class="lead">The demo itself was held on Thursday the 22nd of November, I was the first in at 10am. Upon meeting with my supervisor, I began my presentation of all the deliverables I had and attempting to explain them all in as much detail as possible.</p>
			<p class="lead">Upon completion of my demo I was given some fairly deflating news that my ethics had been rejected however I was advised not to worry as there was still a final meeting to decide on the course of action regarding my project. </p>
			<p class="lead">The final step of this process was to submit the all deliverables to Blackboard and with that done I had successfully finished the feasibility demo.</p>

			<h1>Semester 2</h1>	
			<h1>Week 1 </h1>
			<p class="lead">The second semester of work began on the 14/01/2019, upon returning from the winter break this week was focused primarily on identifying where I had left off and what I still had left to do.</p>
			<p class="lead">Due to the denial of ethical approval for my originally proposed project I was forced to change the focus of my project thereby derailing all momentum built up before the end of term 1. As a result of this I had taken the last week of my holiday to research data on the new subject instead of having it as time off as originally budgeted. This sacrifice allowed for more time to be focused on the interviews and development.</p>
			<p class="lead">Upon returning a meeting was held on the 16/01/2019 with my supervisor and all other students she was supervising. This meeting was hosted to outline what was expected of us this semester as well as a more in-depth look into required artefacts and a general Q&A session. This session helped immensely as it provided a good jumping off point for the rest of the project.</p>
			<p class="lead">The rest of the week consisted of reading and reviewing previously accumulated research in addition to the extra information provided by my supervisor at the group meeting. My supervisor had contacted me later in the week to arrange out first one on one meeting of the semester, dated for 25/01/2019. The goal was to aim to have a more defined idea of final implementation for the newly proposed project. </p>
